# Formalization of the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture in the UOR Framework

This repository contains the formalization of the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) Conjecture using the Universal Object Reference (UOR) framework. The work develops a unified embedding of elliptic curve data (including rational points, the group law, and the \(L\)-function) into a Clifford algebra setting and constructs associated operators whose spectral properties mirror the analytic behavior of \(L(E,s)\). The ultimate goal is to provide a conceptual and computational framework in which the equality

\[
\mathrm{rank}\,E(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathrm{ord}_{s=1} L(E,s)
\]

emerges naturally.

## Overview

Key features of this work include:
- **UOR Embedding:** A unified construction embedding the Mordell–Weil group \(E(\mathbb{Q})\) and the zeros of the \(L\)-function \(L(E,s)\) into a real Clifford algebra \(\Cl(V)\) with an associated Lie group \(G\) of symmetries.
- **Operator Construction:** The formulation of an operator \(H_E\) whose spectrum (in particular, the multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue) reflects the analytic rank of \(E\).
- **Trace Formula:** A derivation of a trace formula within the UOR framework that links the spectral data of \(H_E\) with geometric data (such as Frobenius actions and rational point counts).
- **Worked Example:** A detailed example is provided for the elliptic curve
  \[
  y^2 + y = x^3 - x,
  \]
  (LMFDB label 37.a1) which has conductor 37, rank 1, trivial torsion, and a simple zero of \(L(E,s)\) at \(s=1\).
- **Numerical Computations:** Numerical verifications (using SageMath and LMFDB data) confirm that the computed \(L\)-function derivatives, regulators, and periods match the BSD prediction.
- **Connections to Physics:** Expanded discussion on analogies with quantum mechanics (e.g. the Berry–Keating model), string theory, and condensed matter physics.
- **Future Directions and Open Questions:** Suggestions for extending the framework to higher-dimensional abelian varieties, refining the operator \(H_E\), and exploring further computational and theoretical problems.
